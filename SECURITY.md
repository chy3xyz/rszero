## Security Best Practices

When using rszero in production:

1. **Always use HTTPS** for API endpoints
2. **Rotate JWT secrets** regularly via environment variables
3. **Never commit** secrets to version control
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
5. **Enable rate limiting** to prevent abuse
6. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
7. **Keep dependencies updated** (`cargo update`)
8. **Use circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures
